models, defines the more complex model structure, which contains one-layer-echo-with-dm,one-layer-echo-with-linear-classifiers,two-layers-echo-with-dm,two-layers-echo-with-linear-classifiers,one-layer-rnn-with-different-rnn-types 
runner, aims to help run the script with less code, it is flexible to use.
